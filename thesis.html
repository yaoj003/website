        Through a typography-based video series, I subvert the form of
        self-criticism to comment on the wealthy second generation of youth in
        China. Chinese self-criticism is a public and performative act and has
        historically been a political tool used by Communist Party of China. I
        explore how limited personal and political expression has affected the
        consumption practices of contemporary Chinese youth post-Deng, taking a
        critical look at my own participation within this community. The series
        begins by introducing China after Reform and Opening Up, noting the role
        that conspicuous consumption played in defining identity. From there, it
        follows the experiences of the children of these nouveau riche
        businesspeople and government officials, as they study abroad in America
        and return home, focusing on the role of young Chinese women in creating
        contemporary class culture. This series is divided into three videos,
        each projected onto a luxury item: a Celine Luggage Tote, Rag and Bone
        boots, and a Chloe Faye. These items are a peek into my personal life,
        tying my critique directly to what I own while validating my belonging
        to the community I address.
